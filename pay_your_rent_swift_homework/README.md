## Usage

### Running in Xcode
Open in Xcode 8 or higher, run the default schema.  

The schema is setup to copy the `data/sample.txt` to the built products directory, as well as pass a relative path to the CLI app as an argument.

### From Terminal

To run from a terminal, you would need to compile and run.

```shell
$> xcodebuild
$> ./build/Release/pay_your_rent_swift_homework ./pay_your_rent_swift_homework/data/sample.txt
```
